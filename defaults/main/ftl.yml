# How should FTL reply to blocked queries?
#
# Datatype: string
# Special case:
# * null:
#     Blocked queries will be answered with the 'unspecified address' (0.0.0.0
#     or ::). The 'unspecified address' is a reserved IP address specified by
#     RFC3513 (default).
# * ip-nodata-aaaa:
#     Blocked queries will be answered with the local IPv4 addresses of your
#     Pi-hole. Blocked AAAA queries will be answered with NODATA-IPV6 and
#     clients will only try to reach your Pi-hole over its static IPv4 address.
# * ip:
#     Blocked queries will be answered with the local IP addresses of your
#     Pi-hole.
# * nxdomain:
#     Blocked queries will be answered with an empty response (i.e., there
#     won't be an answer section) and status NXDOMAIN. A NXDOMAIN response
#     should indicate that there is no such domain to the client making the
#     query.
# * nodata:
#     Blocked queries will be answered with an empty response (no answer
#     section) and status NODATA. A NODATA response indicates that the domain
#     exists, but there is no record for the requested query type.

# Disable deep CNAME inspection? Might be beneficial for very low-end devices.
pihole_ftl_cname_deep_inspect: true

# Prevent SNI from being used to determine which websites users are visiting?
#
# Encrypted Server Name Indication (ESNI) prevents on-path observers, including
# ISPs, coffee shop owners and firewalls, from intercepting the TLS Server Name
# Indication (SNI) extension by encrypting it. This prevents the SNI from being
# used to determine which websites users are visiting.

# Overwrite the query source when client information is provided through EDNS0
# client subnet (ECS) information?
#
# This allows Pi-hole to obtain client IPs even if they are hidden behind the
# NAT of a router.

# Control FTL's query rate-limiting.
#
# Rate-limited queries are answered with a REFUSED reply and not further
# processed by FTL. The default settings for FTL's rate-limiting are to permit
# no more than 1000 queries in 60 seconds. Both numbers can be customized
# independently. It is important to note that rate-limiting is happening on a
# per-client basis. Other clients can continue to use FTL while rate-limited
# clients are short-circuited at the same time.
#
# Rate-limiting may be disabled altogether by setting RATE_LIMIT=0/0 (this
# results in the same behavior as before FTL v5.7).
#
# Datatype: string
# Special case:
# * 0/0:
#     Disables rate rate-limiting.
# * 1000/60:
#     Limit to 1000 queries every 60 seconds (default).

# When gravity database is locked/busy, how should Pi-hole handle queries?

# * block:
#     Block all queries when the database is busy. This uses the configured
#     pihole_ftl_blockingmode.
# * refuse:
#     Refuse all queries which arrive while the database is busy. Despite
#     REFUSE sounding similar to DROP, it turned out that many clients will
#     just immediately retry, causing up to several thousands of queries per
#     second. This does not happen in DROP mode.
# * drop:
#     Just drop the queries, i.e., never reply to them at all (default).
